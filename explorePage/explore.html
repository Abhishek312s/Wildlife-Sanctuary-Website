                <span>Overview</span>
                <p>Saving nature is at the very heart of what we do as Bordehi Wildlife. For 60 years, we have made it
                    our mission to find solutions that save the marvelous array of life on our planet by applying the
                    best science available and working closely with local communities.
                    <br> <br>
                    But our work is far from done. Humans are behind the current rate of species extinction, which is at
                    least 100–1,000 times higher than nature intended. We’ve seen an astonishing 60% decline in the size
                    of populations of mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians in just over 40 years, according to
                    WWF's Living Planet Report 2018.
                    <br><br>
                    And the impacts will reach far beyond the potential cultural loss of iconic species like tigers,
                    rhinos and whales.
                    <br><br>
                    The good news is we’ve also seen what’s working. Bordehi Wildlife has been part of successful
                    wildlife recovery stories ranging from southern Africa’s black rhino to Red Panda in India. And
                    this, in turn, is helping to protect rich and varied ecosystems while ensuring people continue to
                    benefit from nature.
                    <br><br>
                    This much is clear: we cannot afford to fail in our mission to save a living planet.

                <span>What Bordehi is Doing</span>
                <p><b>DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF Endangered Animals</b> <br>
                    WWF aims to double the world’s endangered animal population by 2022. We’re working with world
                    leaders to take action, focusing conservation efforts in key sites, raising funds to permanently
                    protect landscapes, and supporting community-based conservation. Saving tigers is about more than
                    restoring a single species. As a large predator, tigers play an important role in maintaining a
                    healthy ecosystem. Every time we protect a tiger, we protect around 25,000 acres of forest—forests
                    that sustain wildlife and local communities and supply people around the world with clean air,
                    water, food, and products.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>EMPOWER PEOPLE TO PROTECT WILDLIFE</b> <br>
                    Over the last few decades, conservationists have come to understand just how central community
                    involvement is to wildlife conservation success—and how important it is for communities to actively
                    steward the natural resources around them to improve economic and social well-being. WWF’s
                    community-based conservation work today reflects this fundamental reality. We work across a variety
                    of communities and customize our work based on the specific needs and interests of a given place,
                    taking into consideration each region’s particular set of conservation assets and challenges.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>CLOSING ASIA'S IVORY MARKETS </b> <br>
                    Illegal killing of elephants for ivory decimates global populations. Estimates indicate that each
                    year poachers slaughter close to 20,000 elephants, mostly for their tusks. Fueling this rampant
                    poaching is a steady consumer demand for ivory. Overall, we see demand increasing in East Asian and
                    Southeast Asian markets, with the greatest demand in China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Thailand. WWF
                    is working to shut down the illegal markets in Thailand, and helped end the legal ivory trade in
                    China. By tackling these markets now as part of a pan-Asian approach, WWF aims to leverage China’s
                    recent actions to ban the ivory trade to prevent further displacement of the current China ivory
                    trade to nearby countries.
